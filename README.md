# Oauth Sample Project

## Configuration:

In the server folder, update the .env file (consists of example details that don't longer work) with your data by creating an Oauth Client ID [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) and appropriately replacing the existing details with yours.

## Getting Started:

### Client:

```
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Server:

```
cd server
npm i
node index.js
``` 

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to access and use your application.
